# üëã Hi there!

If you‚Äôre reading this, we‚Äôre likely starting to work together and I want to give you a head start on how I show up as a manager. This README is meant to be a simple, honest guide to what I value, what you can expect from me, and how we can work well together.

It‚Äôs incomplete because we're all still learning, but it‚Äôs real. If anything here feels unclear or off, I‚Äôd love to talk about it. Please hold me accountable to these words, and let me know how this could be more useful to you or someone else in the future.

## What I Value

**Psychological safety**  
You should feel safe to speak up, ask questions, or challenge decisions without fear.

**Progress over perfection**  
Shipping working solutions and learning as we go is more valuable than waiting for flawless plans.

**Ownership and accountability**  
I expect each of us to take responsibility for our work, decisions, and how we show up for each other. That does not mean going it alone. It means caring deeply and being proactive.

**Learning and growth**  
We are all works in progress. Curiosity, feedback, and reflection help us grow, both individually and as a team.

**Inclusivity**  
Diverse voices make teams stronger and decisions better. I want everyone to feel like they belong.

## How I Communicate

- I prefer async communication, usually via Slack. A very close second is conversation either in person if possible or over Zoom. Email is 
- I respond faster to clear, action-oriented messages.
- I strive to respond the same day. If something is urgent, say so directly and I will prioritize it.
- I appreciate transparency. Tell me what's working and what is not. No need to wait for a 1:1.

## 1:1s and Feedback

- 1:1s are your time. Bring what matters ‚Äî career, growth, blockers, questions, feedback. Let's save status updates for other forums. 
- I will give feedback early and often, and I hope you will do the same. It will be:
  - Intended to help you grow
  - Focused on the behavior, not the person
  - Actionable and specific
  - Given as close to the moment as possible
- If something is not working for you or for us, I want to know. We build trust through open dialogue.

The most important part of my job is being available to you. If you need to talk, please reach out. I will do my best to make time as soon as I can.

## How I Make Decisions

- I aim to be data-informed, context-sensitive, and human-aware, even when things are messy.
- I value input and seek alignment, but I will make decisions when we need forward momentum.
- I will explain my thinking as clearly as I can, especially when it impacts the team or roadmap.

## What I Expect from You

- **Be kind and empathetic** to each other, to our external stakeholders, and to yourself.
- **Communicate early and clearly.** I would rather hear ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stuck‚Äù than find out weeks later.
- **Take ownership and be accountable.** That means caring about the outcome, following through on commitments, and looping others in when needed. You are not expected to go it alone.
- **Keep growing.** Mistakes happen. What matters is what we learn from them.

## Quirks

- I have strong opinions, weakly held. I appreciate when people challenge my thinking with curiosity and evidence. If you disagree, speak up and share your reasoning. We will make better decisions together.

- When you message me with ‚ÄúDo you have a few minutes?‚Äù on Slack, please include what it is about. I have done it too, but I know it can cause anxiety.

- Similarly, please avoid starting with just ‚Äúhello‚Äù or ‚Äúhey.‚Äù Including a brief summary of your question, query, or comment helps me respond faster and prioritize.

- My brain does not always run on a fixed schedule. Sometimes I will have an instant response. Other times I need to take the idea for a walk, let it simmer, and come back with something more thoughtful. I will try to let you know which mode I am in.

## This is a living document.

If anything here feels off or does not match your experience, I want to know. My door and my DMs are always open.
